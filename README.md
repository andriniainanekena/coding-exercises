# Coding Exercises

This repository is where I store all my completed programming exercises across different languages.

It currently includes exercises in:

- **Java**  
- **JavaScript**
- **Shell**
- And Iâ€™ll add more languages as I learn them!

## Why this repository?

I created this space to:

- Practice coding regularly and improve my skills.  
- Keep track of all my finished exercises in one place.  
- Build a personal collection of coding examples that I can refer back to anytime.
